Link is given to the ready code, youâ€™ll just need to adjust the outcome image as in 
the example utilizing the same or really similar colors.
Here is the link with the code and guidance:

You basically need to adjust the code given above to get the following image :
The first one (girl image) was original one, the second - desired outcome 
( the color range has to be not necessarily 100 percent identical, but at least really similar to the example )
And the outcome should be available in two sizes : 
4900 pixels (70*70), and 11025 pixels (105*105).
